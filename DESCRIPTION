Description: Compute the repeated measures correlation, a statistical technique
    for determining the overall within-individual relationship among paired measures
    assessed on two or more occasions, first introduced by Bland and Altman (1995).
    Includes functions for diagnostics, p-value, effect size with confidence
    interval including optional bootstrapping, as well as graphing. Also includes
    several example datasets. For more details, see the web documentation 
    <https://lmarusich.github.io/rmcorr/index.html> and the 
    original paper: Bakdash and Marusich (2017) <doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456>.
