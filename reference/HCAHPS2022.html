regions nesting 50 U.S. states and 3 U.S. territories) with multivariate
(composite) measures. This is a survey assessing patient experience for
hospitalized care, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers
and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey; also referred to as the CAHPS® Hospital Survey.
The data were publicly released in April 2023 by the U.S. Centers for
Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).
HCAHPS is a standardized and validated survey instrument for evaluating
patient experience. Patient experience is an indicator of healthcare quality
and is defined as the "... range of interactions at patients have with the
healthcare system, including their care from health plans, and from doctors,
nurses, and staff in hospitals..."  https://web.archive.org/web/20230206233908/https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/about-cahps/patient-experience/index.html.
The HCAHPS composite measures consist of multiple questions and, here, are top box scores (see https://www.hcahpsonline.org/en/summary-analyses/).
In addition to patient experience, there are additional measures such as whether the hospital is
recommended or not, the number or participating hospitals, and the survey response rate
Note this is not a representative sample
Measures are averaged at the state/territory level
Respondents were discharged from a hospital between July 2021 to July 2022
Results are patient-mix adjusted, see https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00914.x
