We present extensions and improvements of the version introduced by Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, and Buchner (2007) in the domain of correlation and regression analyses. In the new version, we have added procedures to analyze the power of tests based on (1) single-sample tetrachoric correlations, (2) comparisons of dependent correlations, (3) bivariate linear regression, (4) multiple linear regression based on the random predictor model, (5) logistic regression, and (6) Poisson regression. We describe these new features and provide a brief introduction to their scope and handling.},

Additionally, confidence intervals are calculated by using Fisher's z transform (Gleason 1996). When the figure option is specified, a graph is generated that includes a scatterplot of each subject's observations and a linear fit through those points. This graph assists the user in visualizing the variation amongst subjects.},
